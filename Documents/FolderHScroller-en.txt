ABOUT:

FolderHScroller is a resident software to append a horizontal scrollbar to
every folder pane of the Explorer on Windows Vista or later versions.

In Windows Vista, Microsoft had removed the horizontal scrollbar from the
folder pane of the Explorer.
Moreover, in Windows 7, Microsoft had removed the horizontal auto-scroll
function of the folder pane.
Therefore, we feel inconvenience to the Explorer on Windows 7 or later versions
if the width of the folder tree is larger than the folder pane.

When you execute FolderHScroller, it resides into the system and keeps watch
on the Explorer windows, and it appends a horizontal scrollbar to every folder
pane.
As a result, you can view deep nested folders with the Explorer.

USAGE:

When you execute FolderHScroller, it appends an icon to the notification area,
and it starts to keep watch.
FolderHScroller works to append a horizontal scrollbar to every folder pane
of the Explorer automatically. You will not need to operate it.

If you want to finish the software, click the icon in the notification area
and select the "Exit" menu.
After the operation, the folder panes will not display horizontal scrollbars.
(But, the horizontal scrollbars that the software has already appended are
not removed.)

# You can hide the icon of the software from the notification area by
# the "/noicon" option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND LINE OPTION:

/noicon

FolderHScroller will not append its icon to the notification area.
In this case, if you want to finish the software, use the Task Manager for
terminating the process, or use the "/kill" option.

/kill

It terminates the FolderHScroller process that is running in the system.
Use it when you have hidden the icon by the "/noicon" option.

/monitor

A red dot will be displayed on the task tray icon when the application is operating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETAIL:

The Windows Explorer uses a TreeView control for the folder pane.
A TreeView control usually displays a horizontal scrollbar automatically if
the content is larger than its width.
However, in Windows Vista/7, the Explorer sets a special flag(TVS_NOHSCROLL)
to the window style of the TreeView control, and the horizontal scrollbar is
hidden.
(I don't know the reason. Is it simply a problem of the interface design?)

While FolderHScroller is running, detects the display of Explorer and common-
dialogs, and it removes TVS_NOHSCROLL from the window style of the folder
panes.
Therefore, the horizontal scrollbars are displayed if necessary.
